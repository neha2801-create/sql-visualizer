2. **Write or Select a Query**: Either write your own SQL query in the input box or select one of the example queries.

3. **Run the Query**: Click the "Run Query" button to execute your SQL query.

4. **View Results**: The results will appear below, showing both a tabular view and a visualization.

5. **Understand Execution Order**: For educational purposes, the application shows the order in which SQL clauses are executed.
